## About Me 


<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic_02_about.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
Hi there! I'm a pragmatic dreamer girl who most people refer to as jojo, endearingly. And it helps when there's also an MC named after me and that my life is basically just another episode of bizarre adventures.

I'm from Singapore, and I came to the United States for college, studying Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I've graduated and will be starting work at Two Sigma in the fall. I've also worked at Lyft (California office), Garuda Robotics (Singapore) and the Defence Laboratories (Singapore). I specialize in computer systems and am really interested in Operating Systems :)

## TLDR
<h4>Things I love:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A <strike>good</strike> cup of Coffee: It maybe doesn't even have to be good, I'm just addicted.</li>
  <li>Cake, Cake and Cake. Actually no all kinds of desserts. This deserves a whole page for itself in which I can talk about all the desserts I like.</li>
  <li>Certain Friends and Family. For certain reasons this has to be here so that I will not be roasted for my tier lists.</li>
  <li>Playing a critically acclaimed MMORPG, with an expanded free trial... you know the jive. I'm dedicating a page for my escapades in this game, of course I fking love it. </li>
  <li>Travelling. I love to sight-see, hike and go on spontaneous trips. </li>
  <li>Attempting to Cosplay. I try my best to cosplay my favorite characters from games and anime but because of my height and other factors, I have limited choices of characters if I want to be anywhere near convincing.</li>
  <li>Listening and Making Music. I play the piano (jazz and classical), violin, a bit of the guitar and certain oriental instruments like the erhu. One day I'll attempt to upload some recordings but I love R&B, jazz and I listen to japanese, korean and mando music too. </li>
</ul>

At this point if I go on it's no longer a TLDR so I'll stop here. I'll let my own blog posts do the talking for the rest of the about mes.

## Origins
P.S. I highly regret my choice of this subsection title because it sounds as though I'm an organic piece of vegetable on sale at the mart. That aside, I'm currently based in Pittsburgh where I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Science from <a href="//cs.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a>. I also completed my Bachelors here at CMU in 3 years, but decided to stay to spend 1 more year with my friends and get my masters while I'm at it (also simultaneously a great idea to burn a whole through my wallet with school fees). 

I'm originally from the small island of a city called Singapore, in Southeast Asia. I loved growing up around sky scrapers packed like sardines, amidst crowds speaking different languages and colloquialisms, in a place where tradition and casual festivities are always in the mix with stubborn practicalism. I celebrate the everyday back home. I love my country, I love the food and I love my family and friends there -- I love everything about it, maybe besides the intolerable weather. 

When I was 18, feeling young and adventurous, I decided that I loved my home but even more so I'd love to be seeking out the Great Perhaps out there. And that's how I packed my bags and set off alone, seeking college in the United States, literally half the globe away. This has been one of the best decisions (yet) in my life, because taking that leap of faith outside my comfort zone broadened my perspective by a ton; the sky stretches further along the horizon than what it used to now. 

Much more importantly, along my journey here, I was not alone; I've met many more wonderful people, ever so kind and eccentric in their own fashions. I've travelled and I've heard more than countable number of stories from these fascinating new strokes of colors in my life. Stories hold great power, and this has a considerable influence on my half baked personality anyways. 

My location and whereabouts is currently in flux as I'm on summer vacation back home in Singapore (yay!). I will also be shifting soon to New York City where I will start work as a software engineer at Two Sigma in the fall.
